Hey, this is the Weather Snapper, a Sinatra toy for examining
different weather APIs. The library files driving the application
can stand by themselves, and could be reimplemented as Ruby gems.

### Using Weather Snapper

Really simple: enter your zipcode below, press "Get my weather" and
stand by for your forecast. Try 94530 for a Bay Area location, or **24301**
for somewhere far to the east.

Note: USA locations only for now. Not all zipcode values are assigned,
and an unassigned zipcode currently crashes the application.
